    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: {{lastUpdated}}</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This website provides a simple URL referral and redirection service.
        Protecting user privacy is a fundamental principle of this service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Intentionally Collect</h2>
    <p>
        This service is designed to operate without collecting personal data.
        We do not intentionally collect, store, or profile users.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP addresses</li>
        <li>Access or activity logs</li>
        <li>User-agent strings</li>
        <li>Cookies or tracking pixels</li>
        <li>Referrer headers</li>
        <li>Persistent identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How the Service Works</h2>
    <p>
        When a link is accessed, the request is processed in memory solely to
        perform the redirection. No user-related data is written to disk or
        intentionally retained after the request completes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Link Generation and Expiration</h2>
    <p>
        URLs generated by this service are represented by non-identifying hash
        values. Each generated hash URL is valid for a maximum duration of
        <strong>seven (7) days</strong> from the time of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        After this period, the hash URL automatically expires and becomes
        inaccessible. Expired links are removed or rendered unusable without
        retaining any associated personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Destinations</h2>
    <p>
        Redirected links may lead to third-party websites.
        This service has no control over and is not responsible for the content,
        privacy practices, or behavior of those external websites.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        The service does not retain personal user data.
        Any transient technical data required to fulfill a request is discarded
        immediately after the redirection is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Link metadata required solely to enforce the expiration period is retained
        only for the lifetime of the generated hash URL and is automatically
        removed upon expiration.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time.
        Continued use of the service after changes are published constitutes
        acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        As no personal data is intentionally collected, requests related to data
        access, correction, or deletion are generally not applicable.
